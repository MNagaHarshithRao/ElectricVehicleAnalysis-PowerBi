Power BI Report
The Power BI report file (project01.pbix) contains the following components:

Transformations: The dataset has been cleaned and transformed using Power BIâ€™s Power Query Editor.
Visualizations: Various charts, tables, and graphs have been created to provide insightful analytics.
Dashboards: Interactive dashboards that allow users to filter data and see real-time changes.

# KPI Analysis
This project includes analysis of the following key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess the electric vehicle (EV) market:

Total Vehicles:

Objective: Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) and PHEVs (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles), to assess market size and growth.
Average Electric Range:

Objective: Determine the average electric range of the EVs in the dataset to gauge technological advancements and efficiency of the vehicles.
Total BEV Vehicles & % of Total BEV Vehicles:

Objective: Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset, and calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.
Total PHEV Vehicles & % of Total PHEV Vehicles:

Objective: Identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset, and calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the balance between fully electric and hybrid models.
Visualizations
